# Battleship Final Project
###Sadman Fahmid, Alex Zilbersher, Andrew Sikowitz

Our project is to create battleship using ascii symbols in the terminal between two computers. 
If our goal is attained early, we may move on to create more games that players can play, or variations on battleship. 

To run, you must enter ./client followed by the ip address of the server you wish to connect to, eg: ./client 149.89.150.106
